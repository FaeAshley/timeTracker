# 🎮 Tournament Viewer App

A dynamic frontend web app that displays live tournament data from [MatchPlay.Events](https://matchplay.events), including active matches, player standings, and round status.

## ✨ Features

- View current and past matches with player placements, game titles, and durations
- Toggle between full player standings and current round view
- Standings display includes rank and total points
- Fully frontend-based—no backend or server setup required
- Secure API access using bearer token authentication

## 🛠️ Built With

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic and API handling
- **HTML/CSS** – UI structure and responsive styling
- **MatchPlay.Events API** – External data source for tournaments, matches, and players

## 📦 Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tournament-viewer.git
Open index.html in your browser or deploy it to a static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.).

In script.js, replace the placeholder with your MatchPlay API token:

js
Copy
Edit
const API_TOKEN = "your-api-token-here";
Enter a tournament ID in the input field and click Load Tournament.

🔐 Notes
This app requires a valid MatchPlay API token to access tournament data.

Data is fetched directly from the API and rendered dynamically on the frontend.

No server or database required.
